### 2. Core Functionality

#### 2.1 Three Major Operation Modes

##### 2.1.1 Text-to-Image Generation
Transform text prompts into high-quality images across six specialized themes:

**Theme 1: Photorealistic Scenes**
- **Purpose**: Generate realistic photographs with professional quality
- **Use Cases**: Product photography, portraits, landscape scenes
- **Template Structure**: `A photorealistic [shot type] of [subject], [action/expression], set in [environment]. The scene is illuminated by [lighting description], creating a [mood] atmosphere. Captured with a [camera/lens details], emphasizing [key textures and details]. The image should be in a [aspect ratio] format.`
- **Example**: "A photorealistic close-up portrait of an elderly Japanese ceramicist with deep, sun-etched wrinkles and a warm, knowing smile..."

**Theme 2: Stylized Illustrations & Stickers**
- **Purpose**: Create vector-style graphics, logos, and digital assets
- **Use Cases**: Social media graphics, stickers, icons, branding materials
- **Template Structure**: `A [style] sticker of a [subject], featuring [key characteristics] and a [color palette]. The design should have [line style] and [shading style]. The background must be transparent.`
- **Example**: "A kawaii-style sticker of a happy red panda wearing a tiny bamboo hat..."

**Theme 3: Accurate Text in Images**
- **Purpose**: Generate images with legible, well-placed text
- **Use Cases**: Logos, posters, signage, marketing materials
- **Template Structure**: `Create a [image type] for [brand/concept] with the text "[text to render]" in a [font style]. The design should be [style description], with a [color scheme].`
- **Example**: "Create a modern, minimalist logo for a coffee shop called 'The Daily Grind'..."

**Theme 4: Product Mockups & Commercial Photography**
- **Purpose**: Professional product photography and commercial imagery
- **Use Cases**: E-commerce, advertising, product catalogs
- **Template Structure**: `A high-resolution, studio-lit product photograph of a [product description] on a [background surface/description]. The lighting is a [lighting setup] to [lighting purpose]. The camera angle is a [angle type] to showcase [specific feature]. Ultra-realistic, with sharp focus on [key detail]. [Aspect ratio].`

**Theme 5: Minimalist & Negative Space Design**
- **Purpose**: Clean, spacious designs ideal for text overlay
- **Use Cases**: Website backgrounds, presentation slides, marketing materials
- **Template Structure**: `A minimalist composition featuring a single [subject] positioned in the [bottom-right/top-left/etc.] of the frame. The background is a vast, empty [color] canvas, creating significant negative space. Soft, subtle lighting. [Aspect ratio].`

**Theme 6: Sequential Art (Comic Panel / Storyboard)**
- **Purpose**: Comic-style panels and visual storytelling
- **Use Cases**: Storyboards, comics, illustrated narratives
- **Template Structure**: `A single comic book panel in a [art style] style. In the foreground, [character description and action]. In the background, [setting details]. The panel has a [dialogue/caption box] with the text "[Text]". The lighting creates a [mood] mood. [Aspect ratio].`

##### 2.1.2 Image Editing Mode
Advanced image manipulation using existing images as input:

**Feature 1: Adding and Removing Elements**
- **Capability**: Add new objects or remove existing ones from images
- **Template**: `Using the provided image of [subject], please [add/remove/modify] [element] to/from the scene. Ensure the change is [description of how the change should integrate].`
- **Technical**: Maintains original style, lighting, and perspective

**Feature 2: Inpainting (Semantic Masking)**
- **Capability**: Edit specific parts of images while preserving the rest
- **Template**: `Using the provided image, change only the [specific element] to [new element/description]. Keep everything else in the image exactly the same, preserving the original style, lighting, and composition.`
- **Technical**: Conversational masking without manual selection

**Feature 3: Style Transfer**
- **Capability**: Apply artistic styles to existing photographs
- **Template**: `Transform the provided photograph of [subject] into the artistic style of [artist/art style]. Preserve the original composition but render it with [description of stylistic elements].`
- **Technical**: Maintains composition while changing aesthetic

**Feature 4: Advanced Composition (Combining Multiple Images)**
- **Capability**: Merge elements from multiple source images
- **Template**: `Create a new image by combining the elements from the provided images. Take the [element from image 1] and place it with/on the [element from image 2]. The final image should be a [description of the final scene].`
- **Technical**: Supports up to 3 input images simultaneously

**Feature 5: High-Fidelity Detail Preservation**
- **Capability**: Precise editing while maintaining critical details
- **Template**: `Using the provided images, place [element from image 2] onto [element from image 1]. Ensure that the features of [element from image 1] remain completely unchanged. The added element should [description of how the element should integrate].`
- **Technical**: Preserves faces, logos, and other important details

##### 2.1.3 Chat-Image Mode (Conversational Refinement)
- **Purpose**: Multi-turn conversational image generation and refinement
- **Capability**: Progressive improvement through dialogue
- **Features**:
  - Iterative refinement ("make it warmer", "add more contrast")
  - Style adjustments ("more vintage", "less saturated")
  - Content modifications ("change the background", "adjust the pose")
- **Technical**: Maintains conversation context and image history
